Write a web application with a Java-based backend that will allow calculating the prime numbers using any method (e.g., the Sieve of Eratosthenes).

Example of the user interface: 




Example of the user interface with output: 


The solution should be delivered in the form of link to the project on your GitHub, or a zip archive containing: 

    • The source code 
    • Short instruction on how to run the application 
    • Details of the type and version build tools (if used). 

Other information: 
    • Use Java 11 
    • Starting the application should be possible using only one command.
